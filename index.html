            Ethiopia is the world's fifth largest producer of coffee,and Africa's top 
            producer, with 496,200 tonnes in 2022.  Over 4 million small-scale farmers 
              produce coffee.Half of the coffee is consumed by Ethiopians, 
            and the country leads the continent in domestic consumption.

            in the natural coffee forests of southwest and southeast Ethiopia. Results 
            revealed that both natural (soil, aspect, elevation, climate, geographic location)
             and human factors (cherry harvesting/ handing, theft, forest management)
              considerably influenced the quality of wild Arabica coffee.

            Ethiopian coffee beans are known for their high quality and unique flavour 
            profile. The coffee plants in Ethiopia produce small, round coffee beans. 
            Ethiopian coffee plants are relatively small compared to those grown in other countries, 
            with shrub-like trees that typically only grow to about 10 feet in height.
        </li>
        <li>
            The main coffee regions are Lekempt, Jimma, Limu, Sidamo, 
            and Yirgacheffe, with the newly added Guji and Harrar
        </li>

<h2>
    Origin of coffee</h2>
    <hr>
   <p style="color: black;"> According to <b>Ethiopian</b> legend, a goat herder named Kaldi (or Khalid) discovered coffee when he noticed his
     goats bouncing around energetically after eating cherries off of a tree. Intrigued by their behaviour, Kaldi 
     decided to collect some cherries off the same tree to try. When Kaldi consumed the cherries, he found they 
     had the same energizing effect on him and helped sustain him during his long days. Encouraged by his wife,
      he shared these cherries and their effects with the monks at a nearby monastery, where they were quickly 
      declared “the devil’s work” and thrown into a fire. As the cherries burned away, the beans began to crackle 
      and pop, and the sweet aroma of coffee filled the air. Noticing the scent, the monks pulled the beans from 
      the embers and stored them in a pot of water to cool them down. They later drank this brew and began to consume 
      the stimulating liquid to keep themselves awake during their late night devotions. We’re guessing the smell and 
      taste changed their minds about whose work this was! And although the likelihood of this story is pretty slim, 
      it’s fun to imagine it happened this way.
